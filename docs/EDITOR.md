# The editor

`libs/editor/MarkdownEditor` is the one editing widget: live preview, source
and reading are three modes of it. This page covers the optional parts of how
it takes input.

## Vim key bindings

Settings > Editor > "Vim key bindings" (`editor.vimMode`, off by default).
Off, `keyPressEvent` pays one bool test and nothing else runs. There is no
CMake option, because there is no dependency to drop: the whole thing is
`libs/editor/VimMode.cpp` and a small state struct in `MarkdownEditor.h`.

No vim-emulation library is installed (FakeVim ships inside Qt Creator only),
and none is downloaded, so this is hand-rolled. It is a friend of
`MarkdownEditor` and edits the editor's own buffer, caret and undo stack.

The mode, a half-typed command (`2d`) and the `:` / `/` line show in the
status bar. Normal and visual mode draw a block caret; insert mode keeps the
editor's own bar.

### What is covered

| area | keys |
|---|---|
| modes | `Esc` (and `Ctrl+[`) to normal; `i a I A o O` to insert; `v` characterwise and `V` linewise visual, `o` swaps the selection's ends |
| motions | `h j k l`, `w W b B e E`, `0 ^ $`, `gg G` (`5G` goes to line 5), `{ }`, `f F t T` with `;` and `,`, `n N`, `gj gk` (by drawn line, for wrapped paragraphs); arrows, Home and End also work |
| counts | before a command or a motion: `3w`, `d2w`, `2d3w`, `5x`, `3J`, `4rx` |
| operators | `d c y` with any motion, doubled for a line (`dd cc yy`), `D C Y S s x X`; in visual mode `d x y c s` |
| put and edit | `p P` (character or line, as yanked), `r<char>`, `~`, `J` |
| undo | `u`, `Ctrl+r`; each command is one undo step and a whole insert session is one |
| repeat | `.` repeats the last change, including what was typed in its insert |
| search | `/pattern`, `?pattern`, `n`, `N`: a regular expression, case-insensitive unless it has a capital; shown with the editor's find highlight, cleared by `:noh` |
| ex line | `:w` saves, `:q` closes the tab (refused with unsaved changes), `:q!`, `:wq`, `:x`, `:N` goes to line N, `:noh` |

Notes on behaviour that differs from a terminal vim:

- `j`/`k` move by source line, as in vim; a long paragraph is one line. Use
  `gj`/`gk`, or the arrow keys, to move by drawn line.
- The unnamed register is the editor's own; yanking does not touch the system
  clipboard, so `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+V` keep working beside it. In visual mode
  `Ctrl+C` copies the visual selection.
- In normal and visual mode a Ctrl chord that vim mode does not own
  (`Ctrl+F`, `Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+B` ...) still reaches the editor's normal
  shortcuts. In insert mode every key but `Esc` does: typing, IME,
  auto-pairs, the slash menu and `[[` suggestions are the editor's own.
- Composed (IME) text is ignored outside insert mode; touch and mouse
  selection work as before, and a mouse click while in visual mode drops
  the visual selection.
- With vim mode on, the caret's block always shows its source, also while
  something is selected.

### Not covered

Text objects (`ciw`, `di"`), named registers, marks, macros, block-visual
(`Ctrl+v`), `%`, `>` and `<`, `:s`, `:set`, a count on `.`, `p` over a visual
selection, and `J` in visual mode. Visual mode highlights the character under
the caret by widening the selection by one, which is also why `Ctrl+C` copies
exactly what is highlighted.

### Tests

`tests/test_vim.cpp` drives a real `MarkdownEditor` with key events (motions,
operators, counts, undo, mode switches, search, the ex line, IME, the caret);
`tests/test_window.cpp` covers the setting, the status bar and `:w`.
